* Part 2. Setup packages and tools
* Part 3. Create and configure control-plane node
* Part 4. Cluster networking with node
* Part 5. Test nodes, remove taints

Why does it matter? Knowing how to deploy Kubernetes (k8s) cluster is a handy skill which gives an opportunity to learn the technology further or simply get skill-up.

This skills would allow to bring up cluster which are easy to update, test and scale.

During the process some new look on usage of k8s cluster could be discovered.
